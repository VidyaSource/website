                    A lesson we have learned many times, sometimes painfully, is that even the most far-reaching
                    and well meaning technological transformation has no chance for success without a strong organizational
                    culture that promotes the right values. As we emphasize in our <a href="/courses/modern-agile">agile course</a>,
                    a positive culture breeds comfort with experimenting with new technologies and encourages
                    the sharing of ideas and the collaboration necessary to implement them effectively. With technologies
                    and really the entire world changing constantly, a strong culture can be the reliable, sound
                    foundation for your organization.

                    Of course, organizational psychologists have been researching what it takes to do that for decades. It
                    isn't easy, but at least in technology-related areas, we can help.

                            Technology is meaningless without the ability to express its power through engaging
                            verbal and written communication. Whether explaining the value and risk of a particular
                            technology to customers or writing concise but thorough prose in a proposal, we can

                            Clients come to Vidya when they are concerned about the direction of their technology strategy. Sometimes it's a particular
                            software application that lacks documentation, is difficult to change without worrying the whole thing will blow up, or has proven unreliable to the point
                            of losing data. Sometimes it takes forever to deploy to production. Or maybe you are having trouble

                            It may not be obvious, but two areas of your organization critical to the success of technology initiatives
                            are contracting and recruiting. Too often contracts motivate the wrong goals and therefore yield the wrong results. Meanwhile,
                            it's hard to know where to look for talent, and <a href="/blog/why-coding-interviews-are-the-worst">technology interviews have been broken for a long time</a>.
                            Both of these things wreak havoc on your technology culture.

                            After the debacle with the initial rollout of HealthCare.gov, we worked with the Executive Office of the President to help the government
                            identify ways <a href="https://www.fai.gov/certification/fac-c/contracting-fac/fac-c-digital-services">to improve the procurement process</a>
                            to produce better technology outcomes, and many of the same ideas apply outside government. We have also supported
                            recruiting activities extensively to provide candidates that are the best match for your technology challenges and your
                            organizational culture. They will be just as happy to work in your organization as you
                            are you to have them.
