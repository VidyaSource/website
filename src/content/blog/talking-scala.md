If you are in the Washington, DC, area and love free pizza, I will be speaking at [Polyglot Programming DC](http://www.meetup.com/Polyglot-Programming-DC/events/221524361/) a
week from today on Scala, a hot programming language for everything from web development to
"Big Data" to Android development.

Also, free pizza.
