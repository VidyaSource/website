It was an honor for me to participate in the Model Context Protocol Roundtable at the [NOVA SART Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/nova-architecture-round-table-meetup/) hosted by Solution Street. I had so much fun sharing and gaining insights and meeting wonderful 
people as we all try to make sense of how AI and MCP are shaping our own personal experiences as well as application architecture in the enterprise.

Thanks to Solution Street's Katie Schuman for organizing everything and to Gregory Hodum for leading the discussion. Thanks also to Soujanya Vullam from Yahoo and 
Pervez Choudhry from Gentoro for being great fellow panelists and for teaching me so much. And of course thanks to everyone who attended for their attention and stimulating questions.

We covered a lot of ground including the following:
- MCP primitives like clients, servers, prompts, and resources
- Security, observability, type safety, Dome Driven Design, and other software engineering disciplines that are critical for AI
- Why AI will not take your job and in fact will demand even more software expertise
- Real-world use cases for MCP
- MCP tools you can use today for free to improve life at work and home

It was a really fun discussion. Check it out below and [get in touch](/contact) if you want to talk more!
