The Bureau of Consular Affairs at the United States Department of State provides numerous services to Americans living in the United States and around the world. 
For example, Americans living abroad who become parents can get a Certificate of Birth Abroad for their children, and visitors
to America obtain visas from the State Department. As you might expect, the most popular service the State Department
provides is passports for Americans who want to travel abroad. For many years, the State Department has constructed an elaborate
software and data architecture to automate as much of these services as possible. As all large organizations inside and outside 
government understand, it is critical whenever possible to invest in modernization to improve 
user interfaces, performance, and security and ultimately make the user experience as efficient and intuitive as possible for both 
State employees and customers. 

In 2019, Vidya joined the most recent modernization effort as software architects. Anyone who has worked on large-scale modernizations
knows how difficult it is to build new services alongside existing services and integrate them as seamlessly as possible so there are limited service disruptions 
to end users. There are techniques like [feature flags](https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html), 
[blue/green deployments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/overview-deployment-options/bluegreen-deployments.html), 
and [canary deployments](https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/deployment-strategies/canary). You probably know Martin Fowler
as one of the signatories of the Agile Manifesto, and it seems like half his website is dedicated to modernization with
discussions of [seams](https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/uncovering-mainframe-seams.html) and 
[integration](https://martinfowler.com/articles/cant-buy-integration.html) among many other related topics. Then on top of the technology,
there are issues of culture like product management, continuous deployment, and organizational psychology. For all these reasons,
modernization is one of the most challenging feats in our field.

I am proud to report that Online Passport Renewal (OPR) 


Still, I want to take stock and savor this opportunity. It feels so great to [win](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J12IeS7BDoo).
