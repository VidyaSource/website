I had the opportunity to appear on the Guidance Counselor 2.0 Podcast with [Taylor Desseyn](https://twitter.com/tdesseyn), one of the best tech
recruiters in the country and an expert at helping recruiters and engineers understand each other. Follow
Taylor to learn more about how to get the right job in tech for you.

Please check out [my conversation with Taylor](https://www.linkedin.com/video/live/urn:li:ugcPost:7104832496722173953/). 
We discussed [what makes the McKinsey developer productivity analysis 
so terrible](/blog/the-mckinsey-developer-productivity-analysis-is-a-ruse), how developers can achieve
[flow state](https://leaddev.com/culture-engagement-motivation/why-flow-matters-more-passion), the importance of adapting your
remote work policies to the needs and culture of your organization, and a lot more.

I hope you enjoy it! Feel free to [let us know what you think](/contact).
