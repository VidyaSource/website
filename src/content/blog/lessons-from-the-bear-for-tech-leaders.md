 I was late to the party, but I now understand why The Bear is an Emmy award winning TV show. The story is fascinating, and the ensemble
 cast is among the best casts ever. It's a show about a restaurant, but I watched an outstanding episode recently
 that offers surprising lessons for tech leaders.
 
## A quick summary of The Bear

If you've never seen it, The Bear is a dramatic comedy about Carmy Berzatto, a young chef from a working class family in Chicago
who leaves a difficult past behind to train with the greatest chefs in the world and learn the high pressure world of fine dining. Carmy
is gifted, intense, sensitive, and terrified of failure, and these traits come into focus in tragedy when he must return home
because his beloved older brother Mikey, a pillar of the community and owner of a popular sandwich shop called The Beef, has ended his own life. 
To Carmy's surprise because Mikey never let him work at The Beef, Mikey left the restaurant to him, so he sets about bringing his
experience with high-end, fastidious kitchens to a decidedly chaotic kitchen. 

I will leave it there to avoid spoilers, but The Bear is about much more than Carmy. Over the course of three seasons so far, the show introduces us to an array of fascinating
characters with their own compelling stories. One of them is Tina, a sous chef fiercely loyal to Mikey who bristles with hostility
at the changes Carmy imposes to raise the quality of The Beef. In the best episode of Season 3, Episode 6 called "Napkins," we learn exactly why Tina is so loyal to Mikey,
and her story offers lessons that tech leaders would do well to heed.

## Lesson 1: Treat job candidates with respect.

"Napkins" is a flashback episode that shows us how Tina met Mikey and joined the staff of The Beef. After 15 years at a company
doing payroll, they lay her off, and at age 46 Tina faces a world that has transformed since the last time she was in the job market. It's 
all about LinkedIn now instead of professional rapport and well-formatted resumes. Tina's optimism and confidence melt into frustration and disappointment as 
one Gen Z HR kid after another dismisses her with a perfunctory "We'll let you know." Meanwhile, her husband makes little 
as a doorman as his boss casually dangles the possibility of a promotion that never materializes, and they have a son. All of this makes 
Tina feel worthless.

As tech leaders, we make choices that define the culture of our organizations. While it may be easier to exert draconian command and control
that promotes fear of reprisal, it's healthier and better in the long run to promote psychological safety, collaboration, and respect. 
That will naturally extend to people who express a desire to join your organization. For reasons we can discuss another day, tech seems to have
more skepticism at best and contempt at worst for job candidates than any other industry. Instead, honor their interest in joining your team
by respecting their time and acknowledging that they are three-dimensional human beings whose livelihoods may very well be in your hands. Act
accordingly. 

## Lesson 2: You don't need "passion" to excel in tech.

Every 

Tina says in a fit of pique at the dismissiveness of corporate America, 

> I don’t need to be inspired. I don’t need to be impassioned. I don’t need to make magic. I don’t need to save the world, you know? I just wanna feed my kid.
