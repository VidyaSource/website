When I spoke at the [MCP Roundtable](https://www.vidyasource.com/blog/vidya-talks-ai-and-mcp/), one of the points I made is that MCP wouldn't really hit until it "grew up" by becoming 
a real standard. HTTP, HTML, JSON, and other standards changed the world only because of the W3C, a global consortium transcending vendors and corporate strategies with a grand vision for the web.

That, and more, has now happened.

## The News

The Linux Foundation has [announced](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-announces-the-formation-of-the-agentic-ai-foundation) formation of the Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF), 
a neutral, open-governance initiative designed to accelerate the evolution of Agentic AI.

AAIF unites some of the leading industry players with the leading open technologies—MCP from Anthropic, Goose (which I also discussed at the MCP Roundtable and use regularly) from Block, and AGENTS.md from OpenAI—into a unifying vision for agents.

Why does this matter?

- AAIF establishes shared, vendor-neutral standards for building and coordinating AI agents.
- AAIF breaks down proprietary silos to enable interoperability across tools, platforms, and organizations.
- AAIF shifts Agentic AI from fragmented experiments to a more unified, production-ready ecosystem.

This is exciting. It's wonderful finally to see global, open technical consensus building around AI.
