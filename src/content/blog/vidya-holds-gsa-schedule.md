I am excited to announce Vidya, LLC has been awarded a GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) contract for providing IT Professional Services to the government.

Our GSA MAS contract gives us the opportunity to join other contract holders in a marketplace so we can sell our 
software architecture, software engineering, and software consulting services directly to the federal government. Government 
agencies can trust that Vidya has been vetted for a history of delivering high-quality software to a wide array of government and commercial clients
using exciting technology while promoting lean principles, agile software development, and diversity in software engineering. 
Vidya can enjoy direct access to government customers who need our services with faster award times.

It's a win-win!

I am confident that Vidya has even more to offer government customers particularly in the area of architecture
and modernization using powerful techniques and technologies proven in industry, and this GSA MAS contract award confirms
that government shares my confidence. For those well versed in GSA Schedules, Vidya's Special Item Number (SIN) is 
[54151S](https://www.gsa.gov/technology/it-contract-vehicles-and-purchasing-programs/multiple-award-schedule-it/it-professional-services).

We look forward to building new relationships and to delivering our services to even more government agencies. We are also excited about expanding
our current offerings by making our courses available online and building new software products that we expect will also be on a
GSA Schedule one day.

We want to thank GSA for recognizing Vidya's past success and future potential, and we cannot wait to do business
with you. [Let's talk](/contact).
