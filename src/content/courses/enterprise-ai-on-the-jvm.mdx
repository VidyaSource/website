                Every organization wants to make AI work, but FOMO is not a strategy. <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/06/11/ai-companies-employee-fatigue-failure/">Study</a> after <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/mit-report-95-percent-generative-ai-pilots-at-companies-failing-cfo/">study</a> shows even big companies are having trouble
                making AI work for them. There are a lot of reasons. Leaders have no clear business objectives. They lack a data strategy. They also fail to understand that
                context and structure are essential to the success of enterprise AI at scale.

            <p className="mt-4 text-lg font-medium text-gray-dark dark:text-blue-light lg:font-normal">
                While Python is great for computation and experimentation and therefore a great fit for machine learning, it's not great for context and structure. This is where JVM languages
                like Java, which has dominated the enterprise for decades, and more recently Kotlin excel. <span className=" text-red dark:text-red-light font-semibold">Enterprise AI on the JVM</span> teaches
                 you how to build robust, production-grade AI at scale on a proven, reliable platform.

                    This is one of the first courses of its kind because Python had a first mover advantage in the transition from machine learning
                    to AI. It's only recently that businesses are starting to discover the limits of Python at enterprise scale that have hindered it for decades
                    while Java, C#, and more recently TypeScript dominate. Enterprises have literally invested billions of dollars in JVM applications,
                    and the JVM has risen to the occasion to offer some amazing options for AI applications in the enterprise that can leverage those investments.

                    <span className="text-red dark:text-red-light font-semibold">Enterprise AI on the JVM</span> begins with an introduction
                    to AI concepts, the software engineering principles we have honed for decades that are essential to production AI, and the strengths the JVM offers over Python
                    for the enterprise. You will then learn four frameworks that make it easy to bring all these ideas together:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Spring AI</li>
                        <li>LangChain4j</li>
                        <li>Embabel</li>
                        <li>Koog</li>
                    </ul>
                    Each framework approaches AI at different levels of abstraction with different design philosophies, so you will learn what they have in common but also how to decide
                    which applies best to what you want to build. The course concludes with a short discussion of agent architecture patterns.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-dark dark:text-blue-light">
                    When you finish this course, you will be an expert at building AI systems in production at scale. You will even be able to
                    apply your skills across technology stacks. You will build better architected AI systems in TypeScript, C#, and of course Python if you have to.
