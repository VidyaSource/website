                According to Oracle, almost 20 billion devices run Java around the world. Java was the first language for Android. Java runs AI, microservices,
                serverless, machine learning pipelines, and so much of the critical infrastructure in modern applications.

                <span className=" text-red dark:text-red-light font-semibold">Java For Work</span> builds on the foundation of
                low-level primitives like conditionals and loops with a thorough treatment of object-oriented programming, functional and
                asynchronous programming, and software engineering best practices to enable you to build sophisticated Java programs in the real world.

                    The typical Java course teaches you how to code in Java but not how to engineer in Java. You go
                    back
                    to work completely unprepared for the challenges you will face when your team expects you to
                    deliver for a real customer.

                    <span className="text-red dark:text-red-light font-semibold">Java for Work</span> operates from the premise that the
                    greatest asset in professional software engineering isn’t what you know but how fast you can
                    learn.
                    Here you solve unfamiliar problems by consulting your peers like us and Google and Stack
                    Overflow for ideas.
                    Just like every day at work. Skills ignored by other Java courses like testing, error handling,
                    and deployment
                    become second nature. The course concludes with a brief discussion of other languages that build
                    on Java’s legacy like
                    Kotlin and Scala.

                    engineer.
