                According to Oracle, almost 20 billion devices run Java around the world. Java was the first language for Android. Java runs AI, microservices,
                serverless, machine learning pipelines, and so much of the critical infrastructure in modern applications.

                <span className=" text-red dark:text-red-light font-semibold">Java For Work</span> builds on the foundation of
                low-level primitives like conditionals and loops with a thorough treatment of object-oriented programming, functional and
                asynchronous programming, and software engineering best practices to enable you to build sophisticated Java programs in the real world.
                You won't find a more comprehensive discussion of key topics like AI, structured concurrency, functional programming, cloud native APIs, and observability anywhere else.

                    The typical Java course teaches you how to code in Java but not how to build production software in Java. They are not the same thing, so the typical course sends you
                    back to work ready to solve toy LeetCode problems but completely unprepared for the challenges you will face when your team expects you to deliver for real customers.

                    <span className="text-red dark:text-red-light font-semibold">Java for Work</span> operates from the premise that the
                    greatest asset in professional software engineering is not memorizing the syntax of particular programming languages but instead
                    understanding the craft of software engineering. The course uses Java 25, the latest LTS version of Java, to describe how best to
                    apply modern Java to solve real problems using hard lessons learned over many years about the best ways to architect and design your code
                    for maintainability and productivity.
