quote: I have built several Scala and Spark applications currently in production and I worked with the original Spark team, AMPLab at UC Berkeley, on a research project for DARPA known as XDATA. Somehow I have helped enough developers around the world to earn Spark and Scala badges on Stack Overflow. I am passionate about Spark and look forward to helping you harness its power.

                Apache Spark is great for organizations who want their analytics developed fast and executed fast, but
                large-scale distributed computing is hard. It’s not like you can set a breakpoint on code running on multiple machines
                when things go wrong. Monitoring your analytics jobs and optimizing accordingly are important. You
                also have to rethink the way you approach concepts like architecture, security, and software
                engineering techniques like testing and DevSecOps.

                you how to leverage just enough Scala to integrate powerful data pipelines into your existing
                architecture. You will also learn how your pipelines can benefit from the same testing, continuous
                integration, containerization, and security as other components of your enterprise.

                    Spark is a huge topic, and the typical Spark course tries to cover too much in
                    too short a period, which leaves you overwhelmed, and ignores any discussion of
                    architectural patterns and software engineering--the things that separate experiments
                    in your garage from critical pieces of your production architecture.

                    We take a more practical approach. Our rich code examples provide deep insight
                    into the API as you’d expect, but the exercises utilize real datasets from Data.gov and
                    encourage you to collaborate with your peers, the Spark Scaladoc, Generative AI, and
                    other sources just as you would at work. We also advise you on where you should draw the line between configuring Spark yourself
                    and outsourcing configuration to a provider so you can focus on what you care about.

                    In addition, agile software development and DevSecOps have taught us to incorporate quality through
                    build automation, testing, and continuous delivery. We don’t have
                    to abandon them just because we are working in a distributed environment. In fact, the
                    complexity of distributed systems makes them even more valuable. <span

                    you how to apply these techniques to improve the quality and
                    reliability of your analytics.
