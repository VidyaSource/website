                It's been two decades since the Agile Manifesto, and its impact on software development has been so profound that
                every project claims to be agile. There's a backlog. The whole team mumbles its way through pointless meetings where no one sits because, hey, that's the price of innovation.
                In the end, you know full well there is nothing agile about your project.
                It's just rituals to market an agile facade when you're all really just papering over waterfall. Sound familiar?

                <span className=" text-red dark:text-red-light font-semibold">Modern Agile</span> teaches you how to move past performative ceremonies,
                to build products rather than languish in projects. What matters
                most of all is outcomes. How you get there day to day depends on your organizational culture, market forces and personnel. You will
                learn about the keys to delivering the highest quality software in the least amount of time spending the least amount of money.

                    In tech we often see valuable ideas become confusing if not controversial or meaningless
                    buzzwords because consultants misrepresent the ideas to make money. There is no better example of this than "agile." No one has
                    captured this sad reality better than Ron Jeffries, one of the signatories of
                    the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/" className="italic dark:text-green-light dark:hover:text-red-light">Agile Manifesto</a>, whose disgust with
                    the "Agile Industrial Complex" is so overwhelming that he resigned himself to advise
                    us <a href="https://ronjeffries.com/articles/018-01ff/abandon-1/" className="italic dark:text-green-light dark:hover:text-red-light">Developers
                    Should Abandon Agile</a>. Not
                    the principles but the machinery that has given us heavyweight derivatives like Scrum and SAFe,
                    pointless certifications, and worst of all,
                    unhappy engineers and bad software.

                    We won't sell you any kind of one-size-fits-all approach
                    because there isn't one. We don't know what will work for you. We will introduce you to many techniques
                    you can apply to be truly agile and optimize for delivery, and we know what the highest performing
                    organizations, in and out of tech, have in common. We will guide you towards deciding which of these
                    technical practices make the most sense for you, so you can become a high performing organization in
                    your own right doing it in a way uniquely yours.
