In 2011, Eric Ries published *The Lean Startup*, and it revolutionized software development. Lean principles
had already [made it into agile software development](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/194338.Lean_Software_Development),
but *The Lean Startup* fills in a lot of gaps to turn the abstract
[Principles behind the Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) into something real.

For example, even if you nailed agile and built the thing right, how do you know you built the right thing? In other words,
it's great to execute on your project and build exactly what you intend on time and on budget, but when you're done, how
do you know people will actually buy it? Although the Agile Manifesto never answers this question because it assumes you
are on the right track all along, Ries gives us an answer.

## The Minimum Viable Product

Probably the most profound innovation in *The Lean Startup* is the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

(You can [watch Ries himself talk about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4ex0fejo8w), but I have to warn you
that it looks like it was filmed by the director of [The Blair Witch Project](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/how-blair-witch-project-manages-scare-without-showing-anything-supernatural-135492).)

The idea is really quite simple. Whether you are conscious of it or not, the product you have in mind is based on your
assumptions about what your customers want and why, so the purpose of the MVP is to validate those assumptions with
hard data around *a lightweight representation of your product* before you commit your full resources to building out in full.
You give your early adopters access to your MVP and consider their feedback, which Ries calls "validated learning." Validated
learning is crucial. For Ries, it's quantifiable feedback that is "the unit of progress for lean startups."

Based on what you learned, you either "[pivot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n67RYI_0sc0)"
to something else more aligned to what your customers want or "persevere" because you had it right all along. From this point on,
you have quantifiable, proven demand for your product, and you can be confident that you will be investing in building
the right thing.

Like a lot of terms in tech that blow up, consultants often use MVP to mean something different from what Ries intended--most commonly
to mean the first version of a product and/or a really scaled down version of the product. In either case you've implicitly
decided without any validated learning what you want to build. The fact it's in its earliest stages is irrelevant.

So what does all of this have to do with Marvel?


## The MCU Juggernaut

Unless you have been living in the [Quantum Realm](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Quantum_Realm) for the last decade,
you know the [Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)](https://www.marvel.com/movies). It's a monumental achievement in cinema 
that has taken decades of Marvel comics and reformulated them into a multibillion dollar juggernaut movie franchise that has 
raised once second-tier heroes like Iron-Man, Thor, and Black Widow to the stature of eternal favorites like Spider-Man, 
Captain America, and Hulk and put [Mjolnirs](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mjolnir) and 
[Infinity Gauntlets](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Infinity_Gauntlet) into the homes of ardent fans worldwide.

It may be hard to imagine now, but there was no guarantee of success at the beginning as Marvel was struggling as a business
having sold off their most bankable assets. This forced Kevin Feige, the architect of the MCU, to get creative to and 
[derive new ways to bring Marvel heroes to life](https://www.vox.com/2016/5/9/11595344/marvel-cinematic-universe-captain-america-avengers).

They succeeded spectacularly, and now they have to do it all over again.

Firmly entrenched in global pop culture, the MCU now faces pressure to build on its foundation with new heroes and villains,
many of whom like [Shang-Chi](https://www.marvel.com/characters/shang-chi/in-comics) and [Kang the Conqueror](https://www.marvel.com/characters/kang),
are all but unknown to mainstream audiences. And considering that the MCU has decided to go all in on the 
[Multiverse](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Multiverse), there are literally infinite possibilities for stories.

How can Marvel decide what direction to take with the MCU?


## *What If?* is Marvel's MVP
