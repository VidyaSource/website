Component libraries are all the rage. Shopify, Salesforce, IBM, and even the [United States government](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/overview/)
have joined countless other organizations and businesses in building component libraries. They're the subject of blog posts,
podcasts, and YouTube tutorials. All that's left is a [Ken Burns documentary](https://kenburns.com/the-films/) on the subject.

In fact, I am a software architect and senior engineer, and I currently lead the development of a React component library that will be the basis for the UIs for a 
prominent US government agency. I want to share with you my lessons learned in project management, communications,
accessibility, engineering, and testing to build something that will impact the lives of millions. And the ups and downs of it all.

So what's the big deal with component libraries?

## The Design System

It doesn't start with a component library; it starts with a design system. The Nielsen Norman Group defines design systems 
[this way](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-systems-101/):

> A design system is a complete set of standards intended to manage design at scale using reusable components and patterns.

A design system enumerates the standards and practices that comprise the premier UX for consumers of your brand. It expresses
the nomenclature every team should use in communications to break down silos and avoid the impulse from [Conway's Law](https://www.melconway.com/Home/Conways_Law.html).
There are basic rules about colors, typography, spacing, and so on. All of these core principles become the basis for larger
components--explicit ones like buttons and date pickers and subtler ones like grid systems.

Our UX team develops and maintains our design system. Like software, it evolves; it's versioned; and it's collaborative. There are conversations
among the UX designers and Ëšwith me and other architects and engineers on the program about what makes sense and what is feasible.
Are nested dropdowns necessary? Do we have time to create our own perfect `Datepicker`? Or do we try to customize something open source?
How do we feel about disabled buttons, and if we think they make sense, how
can we overcome common pitfalls like poor [contrast ratios](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG/Perceivable/Color_contrast)?

Stuff like that. We use the language of [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/), which deconstructs
web interfaces into entities ranging from "atoms" to "pages," as a common nomenclature to describe the goals of the design system.

The challenge, and probably the hardest part of building a component library for us, is the tooling. Partly because of the preferences of the UX team and partly because 
of constraints on our development environment due to the sensitive nature of our work, we have not been able to 
streamline automation for versioning UX wireframes or translating them into artifacts engineers can use to build. As a result,
we work with wireframes that are cumbersome to understand. In order to even view them, we either need to install the tool on our 
machines, which costs more licenses and imposes a burden on developer experience (DX), or we need to wade through literally hundreds of static asset files
with a custom browser plugin. Neither is an optimal experience. Beyond that, it's a manual process to track consistency between the design system and 
the component library as both evolve.

I never said it was pretty, but it isn't all bad either.

## The Value of a Component Library

The design system is a set of core principles independent of implementation details. You can choose to implement these principles
and make them real for UI engineers with whatever technology you choose.

For us, that's React. Our React components generate a lot of value for the program.

### Consistency

Our component library enforces our design system across our development teams. Using the components all but guarantees 
a UI will be consistent with our brand and provide our users the best, most intuitive experience. Developers can feel 
confident they are using components vetted with the UX team, which frees them up to work on the specific use cases of their 
services rather than cross-cutting concerns like consistency with the design system.

The library also maximizes the likelihood that our UIs pass visual testing by our UX team. This is important as violations slow down our delivery cadence
and ability to get feedback.

### Accessibility

Related to consistency is accessibility, which is a first-class priority for our component library. Accessibility, commonly known as [#a11y](https://www.a11yproject.com/), 
is more than just empowering the visually impaired. It also means empowering people who experience difficulty with hearing, 
motion, dexterity, or anything else. It means empowering *everyone*.

The program is required by contract and 
[by law](https://www.access-board.gov/law/ra.html#section-508-federal-electronic-and-information-technology) to produce UIs that 
are accessible--specifically [508 compliance](https://www.section508.gov/tools/playbooks/technology-accessibility-playbook-intro/). 
That said, accessibility is far more than a professional obligation; it is my personal priority. It is very important to me that 
everything I build is intuitive for every user. 

I will elaborate on this shortly, but our component library is built for accessibility. Development teams
can trust the accessibility of the individual components, and as I said before, focus on their own use cases. Of course you
are probably thinking in terms of accessible dropdowns and autocompletes and datepickers, which we have, but we also
provide helper [Semantic HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics#semantics_in_html) components.
For example, the library features `Section`, which represents the `section` [HTML element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section) 
as you would imagine, and `SectionGrid`, which is a `section` element endowed with our design system grid.

Of course, the component library can only take developers part of the way to full accessibility, but it's nice not to have to start from 0.

### Reusability 

We have worked very hard to provide intuitive APIs for our components, but the task is trickier than you might think. The 
APIs need to impose enough opinion so that consumers don't violate the design system but allow enough freedom for the components
to support a wide range of use cases. For our `Button` component, that is easy enough. For layout components like 
`Card` and `Page`, it's tougher. The reusability that results has made individual teams and the entire program so much more productive.

We also go out of our way to endow our components with as little functionality as possible. Component APIs offer props that enable library
consumers on the development teams to supply behavior. For an obvious example, developers supply `onClick` behavior to the
`Button` component. We have more complex components that need to maintain their own state,
but we try to minimize that where possible. This provides a clean separation of concerns, which makes testing our components much easier,
and anyone who has been in the game long enough knows that strong testability makes for strong reusability.

### Encapsulation

There will be more about this shortly, but we do not build our components from scratch. Rather, we customize existing open source
components and map our APIs to theirs. This abstracts the implementation details of the component from our development teams.
For example, we use [react-datepicker](https://github.com/Hacker0x01/react-datepicker) as the basis for our own `DatePicker`,
but if we decide to swap it out for a different one, our consumers will be none the wiser.

## Component Stack

As I mentioned, we build our component library with React, which is what we recommended but is also, for our risk-averse 
government customer, the safe choice given its backing by Facebook, [its market penetration](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#section-most-popular-technologies-web-frameworks), 
and [its popularity](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-webframe-want).

But React is the easy part. Let's look at other parts of the component stack.

### TypeScript

When we started building the component library, I considered TypeScript essential for two reasons. By enforcing type safety during
development and at build time, we catch bugs much faster, which from a project management standpoint is much cheaper. More importantly, 
building our APIs in TypeScript is a huge help to library consumers on application development teams by facilitating code 
completion in their IDEs and type checking in *their* builds.

Let me also mention that some of our TypeScript APIs require [ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) values
to promote accessibility if we can't derive them ourselves from other props.

### Chakra UI

I mentioned earlier that our components are built on open source components, and most of them are built on 
[Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/). There are many other open source component libraries out there, but Chakra UI
is my favorite by far. The primary reasons are its first-class commitment to accessibility and the intuitive APIs of its 
components built with TypeScript. As you can probably infer, Chakra UI is an inspiration to me when building our own 
component library on top of it.

Chakra UI also offers a powerful [theme customization API](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/theming/customize-theme) we leverage heavily
to apply the principles of our design system to Chakra components via dedicated theme files that separate the styling from
functionality. This separation of concerns makes it easier to reason about our code and makes the files themselves 
a lot lighter.

Chakra UI also features with some helpful hooks like [useDisclosure](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/hooks/use-disclosure) that come in handy. 

If you use Chakra UI for your own component library, you will probably need some alias imports to deal with name collisions.
For example, we call our button components, to no one's surprise, `Button`, but so does Chakra UI. So we do this:

~~~js
import { Button as ChakraButton } from "@chakra-ui/react"
~~~



## Engineering

Of course the fun part is building a React component library. This post is long enough, so I can't get into every detail. But
I do want to address some of the key aspects you might want to consider when you build your own.

### Workflow

When we first began building the component library, we needed to move quickly because development teams were waiting on us 
to start building their UIs. Our management tasked me and several developers to get something done in a few sprints at nearly
a full time commitment.

We got the initial design system specification from the UX team and got to work. After those first few sprints, we had built enough components
to allow teams to get going. The problem is that all of us resumed our normal duties with no time allocation for the library. This
meant that whenever the UX team designed new components or developers found bugs in existing components, there was a bottleneck
because no one was dedicated to upgrading the library. I and others got to it when we could, but the absence of a dedicated team
was a problem.

Another problem is the initial lack of communication within the UX team itself and among the UX team, developers, and me. In their creative zeal, 
far too often they provided wireframes to some developers inconsistent with wireframes provided to others, 
or they provided wireframes featuring components that weren't in the library. 
Development teams assumed they *were* in the library and estimated accordingly. As you might expect, they were unhappy when 
they discovered the components didn't exist, which impacted their ability to deliver on schedule. They let me know it, and frankly they
had every right to be unhappy. I knew we had to improve our process.

To that end, we made some changes. We established a Microsoft Teams channel to encourage communication by eliminating
the ceremony of meetings and even E-mails. We also decided that development teams will build new components initially, and if
other teams will benefit, the library will absorb them, with tweaks as needed to APIs or implementations, to support broader 
applicability across the program. Then the team that built the component first will replace their implementation with 
the library's when ready. While this means teams have to devote more time to developing components, it's transparent, and there is no bottleneck. 

This is an evolving workflow. There is always room for improvement.

### Component structure

Our components in TypeScript take three forms.

The simplest components look like this:

~~~js
export const TimePicker = (p: TimePickerProps) => {
    ...
}
~~~

Our `TimePicker` component has no children, so it's as straightforward as it gets. It's just a function!

If the component has children, it still isn't too bad:

~~~js
export const Card: React.FC<CardProps> = p => {
    ...
}
~~~

React's `FC` type (for `FunctionComponent`) includes a `children` prop implicitly. We could also
declare it just as we do `TimePicker` but explicitly add a `children` prop of type `ReactNode` to `CardProps`. I prefer `FC`
because it very clearly signifies the presence of `children` to library consumers and because the type parameter lets me enjoy
some type inference. Notice how I don't have to specify the type of `p` because it's implicit from the type parameter `CardProps`. 

Still, not too bad, right?

The last kind of component is a little complicated--form components. Our developers use [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/),
and like every other form library I've used, it uses `ref`s to maintain form state. This means our components
need to provide a way to accept a `ref` and delegate it to their children. 

Most React engineers don't know this because they don't have to, but React provides a function for exactly this purpose called 
`forwardRef`, and we use it like this:

~~~js
export const Button = React.forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, ButtonProps>(function Button(p, ref) {
    ...
}
~~~

Let me try to break this down.

A [higher-order function](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/functional-programming-in/9781492048633/ch04.html) is
a function that takes functions as parameters or returns a function. Here `forwardRef` takes that `Button` function that renders the component as a parameter.
Thanks to `forwardRef`, development teams can pass refs to the form components in our library, which we pass along though that function parameter
to our rendered implementation. The type parameters to `forwardRef` provide type safety and inference. The type
of `p` is `ButtonProps`, and the `ref` will be hooked onto a `HTMLButtonElement`.

In the end, it's a little complicated and a fair bit of ceremony, but the result is pretty simple--a form component that accepts
a `ref` from the caller so form libraries can work with it as needed.

### Directory Structure

When considering how to lay out your source code, it comes down to your team's preference, but as I tweeted recently:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There is a lot of commentary on how we should lay out source code in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/React?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#React</a>. If you take two &quot;things&quot; (functions, classes, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TypeScript?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TypeScript</a> interfaces, etc.), the higher the frequency that changing one changes the other, the closer they should be together</p>&mdash; Neil Chaudhuri (@RealNeilC) <a href="https://twitter.com/RealNeilC/status/1443309713584689154?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 29, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

What does that really mean in practice?

Simple. When it comes to our component library, this means organizing code dedicated to a particular component in the same 
directory and even in some cases the same file. This is how we do it at a high level.

<img alt="Button component directory layout" src="/img/blog/rcl-button.png" width="356px" height="206px" />

Our `Button.tsx` contains the `ButtonProps` interface, related types, and of course the component itself. Meanwhile, I love
how Chakra UI allows us to separate theming from behavior, so the colors, spacing, font family, icon sizes, focus behavior, and other button
details defined by our design system are in `ButtonTheme.ts`, a different file in the same directory.

Finally, although we could keep our tests and stories (more on these later) in the same directory, we prefer organizing them
in their own subdirectories. I guess I've seen too much Marie Kondo.

### TypeScript Config

I come from a background in [statically and strongly typed programming languages](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2690544/what-is-the-difference-between-a-strongly-typed-language-and-a-statically-typed) 
like Java and Scala. While I understand longtime JavaScript engineers balk at types, I find types make me extremely productive. 
As a result, our TypeScript config is very strict. In particular from our `tsconfig.json`:

~~~json
{
...
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...
    "noUnusedParameters": true,
    "noImplicitReturns": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    ...
  },
...
}
~~~

As for building the library for application development teams, we scope our `tsconfig.json` this way:

~~~json
{
...
  "include": [
    "src/**/*"
  ],
  "exclude": [
    "**/__stories__/*",
    "**/__test__/*"
  ],
...
}
~~~

All our components, stories, and tests are in the `src` directory, but we only want the components when we build the library. 
This is why we exclude the `__stories__` and `__test__` directories inside each component directory.

### Static Analysis and Code Formatting

Like everyone else, we rely on eslint and Prettier, and we don't do anything particularly special. Still, I do want to mention a couple of things.

First is `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`. We use [this eslint plugin](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y)
to automate verification of the accessibility of our component library. It checks the JSX of our components for obvious
violations. This is as far as we can go with automation, but we complement `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` with manual
auditing in Storybook I will discuss shortly.

There might be something gnawing at the experienced engineers reading this. In the `tsconfig.json` above, we exclude our 
stories and tests because they don't belong in the build. Still, you know we should
apply the same quality standards to story code and test code as we do to production code. Code is code.

To do this, we [extend](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#extends) `tsconfig.json` in a file called `tsconfig.eslint.json`,
replacing the `exclude` field with an empty array, and configure `eslint` to use *that*. This tells `eslint` (and therefore Prettier)
to include *everything* in the `src` folder in its analysis with identical TypeScript configuration. This means, for example, we can't cheat
by using an implicit `any` in our stories or tests either.

### Builds

We run our builds with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). That may seem counterintuitive since Vite is the build tool for [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
while our library is built with React, but Vite is actually agnostic. In fact, it amazed me how little configuration we needed.
It basically just worked. Our Vite config is almost identical to the [example in the documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html#library-mode).
Just like the example, our build produces two bundle formats--`es` and `umd`--and it works fast.

As you may know, TypeScript builds feature two phases, type checking and transpilation to JavaScript. Type checking by `tsc`,
the TypeScript compiler, is *very* slow, so while it is very important, you should do it rarely. We only do it via
the IDE in real time as we code or when we build the library for production--and break the build if type checking fails.

We have a dedicated `typecheck` script in our `package.json` that looks like this:

~~~json
{
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "typecheck": "tsc --p tsconfig.eslint.json --skipLibCheck --sourceRoot src --noEmit",
    ...
  }
}
~~~

Note that we use `tsconfig.eslint.json` to typecheck everything.

Meanwhile, transpiling your TypeScript source code to JavaScript is faster than type checking, but so is reading Tolstoy. Transpiling
with `tsc` or Babel is still not fast. However, the transpiler [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) is written in Go, a language [built for speed](/blog/scala-go),
and Vite uses it under the hood. Because we are transpiling constantly to see what's happening in Storybook, it's crucial that the process be fast. Thanks to esbuild,
Vite does exactly what we need.

Our production build, versioned with [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), includes [declaration files](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/introduction.html) 
for each component and an `index.d.ts` file enumerating all components. These improve DX by enabling developers' IDEs to perform
fast code completion. We also provide the [theme file](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/theming/customize-theme) we use for our own components
so that developers can apply the same theme to theirs. Our CI/CD pipeline publishes the library to a primate NPM registry, which
allows appropriately configured `npm` installations on developer machines to fetch the library with a conventional `npm install`.
The `package.json` file accompanying the library contains all the peer dependencies they will need to use the library so `npm`
can grab them, and for convenience it also contains the version of the design system it is built with for developers to track.

It also contains configurations to define which files to package in the library and how consumers can import modules:

~~~json
{
...  
  "files": [
    "dist"
  ],
  "types": "./dist/index.d.ts",
  "main": "./dist/components.umd.js",
  "module": "./dist/components.es.js",
  "exports": {
    ".": {
      "import": "./dist/components.es.js",
      "require": "./dist/components.umd.js"
    }
  }
...
}
~~~  

One last thing to note about the build. Although Vite of course provides minifying and other production readiness capabilities,
we don't use them. We bundle the component library completely "raw." We find this helps developers debug their applications
and report bugs (in those rare cases we make mistakes) with specificity. When they run their own builds, their tooling will apply
minifying, tree shaking, and all other production processing to all their code and dependencies including the component library.

## Testing

As I mentioned before, we limit the functionality of our components to the bare minimum necessary to add value. Still, 
components are code, and our consumers have expectations of our code. This means we need to test our components as much
as we can and where it makes sense.

Testing is a controversial topic. On Tech Twitter, engineers are more than happy to let you know why you are wrong
to test your code in a different way than they do. I can only describe what works for us and why we think so while also
stipulating that our methods are subject to change as we get better at this.

Our approach is heavily inspired by this [Storybook blog post](https://storybook.js.org/blog/how-to-actually-test-uis/). In it,
[Varun Cachar](https://twitter.com/winkerVSbecks) describes different types of testing, when each is appropriate, and which tools
make sense for which types based on the experiences of several large-scale engineering teams. 

### Storybook

Storybook is crucial to the development and testing of the component library for us, and it's indispensable documentation for our users.

During development, we use it in a couple of ways. If the component is simple, then it's nice to have your code and Storybook
side by side and watch your changes render as you make them with hot reload. On the other hand, when we aren't clear on
what the API for a component should be, it's nice to write a few [stories](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/whats-a-story) 
to work out the DX for it. Experienced engineers might recognize this approach as analogous to 
[Test-Driven Development (TDD)](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/tdd/).

We apply our design system custom theme in Chakra UI to every story in `preview.jsx`:

~~~js
export const decorators = [Story => <ChakraProvider theme={theme}>{Story()}</ChakraProvider>]
~~~

During testing, we also use Storybook in multiple ways. For example, because we take a mobile first approach to our components, 
which matters for [organisms](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/#organisms) in particular like modals, we configure custom 
breakpoints like this in `preview.jsx`:

~~~js
export const parameters = {
	viewport: {
		viewports: {
			xs: {
				name: "XS",
				styles: {
					height: "568px",
					width: "320px",
				},
				type: "mobile",
			},
			sm: {
				name: "SM",
				styles: {
					height: "896px",
					width: "480px",
				},
				type: "mobile",
			},
			md: {...},
			lg: {...},
			xl: {...},
		defaultViewport: "xs",
	},
}
~~~

I mentioned a CI/CD pipeline that builds the library and publishes it to a private registry. It turns out the pipeline also publishes 
our component Storybook to an [Nginx container](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx) so that the UX team can conduct visual testing on the
components, and the ability to toggle among viewport sizes is extremely helpful. 

It's also helpful for development teams who use our components to interact with them. Thanks to
[Storybook Controls](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/controls), they can configure components themselves
to see what happens. Thanks to [Storybook Docs](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-docs), they can see the code
and API props that generate each story. So Storybook provides a profound documentation benefit throughout the program.

We also use Storybook for [composition testing](https://storybook.js.org/blog/how-to-actually-test-uis/) occasionally though
not as often as the Storybook team may prefer. For example, we have stories that demonstrate how to integrate our 
form components with React Hook Form, and this exposed issues we had with our `ref`s. Generally though, we don't do a 
lot of composition testing until we need to [reproduce a scenario to fix a bug](https://www.vidyasource.com/blog/code-coverage-is-killing-you) 
(and prove we've fixed it eventually).

We make heavy use of [storybook-addon-a11y](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-a11y) to test for accessibility.
As you can see from another post by [Varun Cachar](https://twitter.com/winkerVSbecks), who is definitely earning his paycheck,
[Storybook offers a lot of features for accessibility testing](https://storybook.js.org/blog/accessibility-testing-with-storybook/).
We make use of all of them. As I mentioned before, even though we do our best with `jsx-a11y` in the build and Storybook 
visually to test for accessibility, it is still incumbent upon teams to add [@axe-core/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@axe-core/react)
to *their* builds and perform their own visual tests in order to feel as confident as we can that we are providing the 
best possible experience to all our users.

Finally, while Storybook has been invaluable for us and I recommend it strongly, I would be remiss if I didn't mention 
some gotchas. Storybook uses a lot of the same libraries we all use for theming, Markdown, and other things. When there are
library conflicts between your version and theirs, bad things happen. For example, we got hit with the same conflict 
on [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) as this [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/15879). 
To its credit, the Storybook team releases frequently. If nothing else, make sure you use identical versions of Storybook and all its addons
and that you upgrade as soon as possible when updates are available. 

Storybook is also well aware of the "DivOps" revolution in JavaScript build tooling [and is positioning itself accordingly](https://storybook.js.org/blog/storybook-for-webpack-5/).
This is exciting since Webpack had a good run but feels more and more like the past, and we wanted to use Vite with Storybook.
We installed [storybook-builder-vite](https://storybook.js.org/blog/storybook-for-vite/) knowing it's experimental
to see how it would work for us. Overall, it makes our Storybook builds fast just as we hoped. Still, when you consider
`storybook-builder-vite` is raw, community-led by great engineers who have already given the community so much with their limited time and
can't address every issue, and the general brittleness of Storybook I mentioned, your mileage may vary. Here is our
Vite-related Storybook configuration in `main.js`:

~~~js
module.exports = {
	...
	core: {
		builder: "storybook-builder-vite"
	},
	viteFinal: async config => {
		return {
			...config,
			plugins: ...,
			optimizeDeps: {
				...config.optimizeDeps,
				entries: [`${path.relative(config.root, path.resolve(__dirname, "../src"))}/**/__stories__/*.stories.@(ts|tsx)`],
			},
		}
	},
}
~~~

### React Testing Library

If you have read any of my posts on testing, you know that I think our industry writ large gets testing wrong. We test some 
things too much. We test other things too little. We don't always know the purpose of our tests. And worst of all,
because of perverse incentives, [we write tests to check a box](https://www.vidyasource.com/blog/code-coverage-is-killing-you).

I mentioned earlier that it has been a priority to endow our components with as little behavior as possible. Aside from the fact
simpler code is easier to maintain and understand, this approach means fewer surprises for our consumers and less for us to test.

Or so I thought.

Our program has a mandatory minimum of 80% code coverage for our applications, and for reasons that don't make a lot of
sense to me, that also applies to the component library. In my view, only components that maintain internal state offer
the complexity that demands the ceremony of formal tests beyond Storybook, but alas, I don't make the rules.

React Testing Library has become the *de facto* standard for [interaction testing](https://storybook.js.org/blog/how-to-actually-test-uis/)
in React, and of course we use it for our own tests. But how could we write tests as quickly as possible to limit the impact
of the code coverage standard?

If you have written tests in any programming language, you understand the concept of "[test fixtures](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12071344/what-are-fixtures-in-programming),"
the setup for your tests. For us, that means test fixtures are simply components configured with different props.

But isn't that exactly what stories in Storybook are?

Storybook offers a feature I love--the ability to import stories into tests written with React Testing Library as fixtures using
[@storybook/testing-react](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/testing-react). Without it, we would need to duplicate 
the same code as stories in Storybook and fixtures in tests. The autocompletion is great too thanks to the 
TypeScript support built into `@storybook/testing-react`.

Aside from all that, our tests work exactly as you would expect if you know React Testing Library.

I know this is a lot, and it might have been slightly more entertaining as an audiobook. Still, I hope I conveyed the 
value in design systems and component libraries and the lessons we learned in project management, communications,
accessibility, engineering, and testing to build something that will impact the lives of millions. I hope you can
do the same...but better.

Now go take a nap. You earned it.
