Tech interviews are broken. Much like with vegan cheese, we all agree there is a problem, but we all differ on how to fix it. How did we get here?

Over the last several decades as tech became a dominant industry, the new personalities that became very rich
very fast also became very Gavin Belson from Silicon Valley—supremely convinced of their own outside-the-box cleverness
not only at producing revolutionary technology but also at revolutionizing the way they build it as a model for everyone else. Remember when open floor plans
with foosball tables were the key to unleashing workplace productivity restrained too long by dehumanizing cubicles? The media 
ate that up!

But we ended up just using headphones to fashion our own mental cubicles so we could work in some kind of awkward peace—particularly awkward
for women, people of color, introverts, and many others.

A similar thing happened with tech interviews. Boring accounting firms ask about your resume but not us! The media were awestruck at
our novel interview style asking weird questions like "*Why are manhole covers round?*" or "*How would you calculate the number of cars passing through a busy bridge?*"
or the famous Elon Musk riddle "*You’re standing on the surface of the Earth. You walk one mile south, one mile west, and one mile north. You end up exactly where you started. Where are you?*"
This was all about getting deeper than any traditional interview could, you see, to reveal how candidates think!

Yeah, OK.

While the more absurd questions have lost some luster, one relic of our unconventional interview style that endures is the 
coding interview. You know it. The panel of dudes all vaguely reminiscent of Howard from *The Big Bang Theory* asks you 
to go to the whiteboard or a laptop broadcasting to a screen and write code for something you've probably never seen (by design).
It could be implementing a doubly-linked list or merge sort or a function that determines if a 
string is a palindrome. It could be performing a breadth-first search or converting a loop into a recursive function. And on and on.

This is a problem—not only for job candidates but also for the companies considering them. It's an especially acute problem now with the shortage of software 
engineers, the popularity of remote work particularly in the aftermath of a global pandemic, the uncertainty tech companies
feel in an era of inflation and changing pandemic fundamentals, and the uncertainty candidates feel in an era of layoffs and evolving 
personal responsibilities and professional goals.

Coding interviews are the worst. How do we know?

## Coding interviews solve for the Computer Science Department valedictorian or the most short term knowledge. Not the best long term culture fit

The biggest problem with coding interviews is the disconnect between what they measure and what actually adds value to the business.
For 99% of you, hiring someone who understands Kruskal’s algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree isn't relevant to 
making your UI accessible, scaling in the cloud, improving your engineering practices, or driving revenue. 

Even if you do better than silly college computer science questions and focus on the tech you use today, you focus on the wrong thing. It isn't what candidates
know; it's how much they can learn. If you're a React shop, it's nice if a candidate understands how `useEffect` is about syncing UI with 
state rather than a new spin on `componentDidMount`, but what if you decide to move to [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/)? Or what if
an important new initiative demands a different set of skills entirely and you don't have the resources to hire a subject-matter expert?

Instead, you want to hire people who fit with your culture and make their teams better with hard and soft skills. They do this is many ways. They listen. They are eager to learn and to help.
They are patient and kind. They manage their time well. They can communicate with customers. They write good documentation.

And they have the ability to think in abstractions so they can translate their prior knowledge into new skills that serve their professional growth and your bottom line.

Your business needs Vision. Coding interviews at best get you Ultron.

## Coding interviews further exclude systematically excluded communities

I am a passionate advocate for diversity in tech. Prejudice against anyone on the basis of race, gender, ethnicity, 
nationality, religion, orientation, ability, or even academic background not only limits our individual growth but also 
limits the creative energy necessary to develop the best software. Sadly, there are countless institutional barriers to diversity
in tech, and coding interviews are one of them.

Don't believe me? Check out this [study by North Carolina State University and Microsoft](https://news.ncsu.edu/2020/07/tech-job-interviews-anxiety/):

> But the format may also serve as a barrier to entire classes of candidates. For example, in our study, all of the women who took the public interview failed, while all of the women who took the private interview passed. Our study was limited, and a larger sample size would be needed to draw firm conclusions, but the idea that the very design of the interview process may effectively exclude an entire class of job candidates is troubling.

Much as society writ large is convinced DNA evidence and machine learning are "objective," tech is at best
convinced coding interviews are also free from bias and at worst happy to capitalize on it. Bias in coding interviews
could be favoritism, intentional or otherwise, reflected in choice of coding problem or leniency in evaluation. They are also
biased against realistic forms of working. In real life, we don't have people staring at us as we type scrutinizing our work and 
mannerisms. We have access to Google, Stack Overflow, and other resources. The discomfort produced by this awkward, contrived situation hurts
otherwise talented candidates—particularly those in communities already systematically excluded in tech like the women in the study.

But that's one study you say. OK, but consider anecdotal evidence from elite engineers. [Jenn Creighton](https://twitter.com/gurlcode),
senior engineer at Netflix on the NodeJS team and host of the [single-threaded podcast](https://twitter.com/single_threaded) exposed the problem on 
her premier episode with her guest [Erin Fox](https://twitter.com/erinfoox). Senior engineer, Apple whistleblower, and activist [Cher Scarlett](https://twitter.com/cherthedev) described 
her own experience a few years ago:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">not work, and wasn&#39;t what they were looking for. These same two pieces of code are now written about by two other individuals as best practice solutions to these problems. Do you think this coding interview was about code? No, it was an ego battle I&#39;d never be allowed to win.</p>&mdash; Cher Scarlett (@cherthedev) <a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/998914080177115136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 22, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Of course if things can get so bad for cis white women in tech that coding interviews become a vanity exercise at their expense, just
imagine how much worse it must be for women of color, trans people, anuerotypical people, even people who learned tech in boot camps 
instead of MIT. And so many others.

Let's use the interview process to welcome as many people as possible into tech because the challenges that lie ahead are too great to leave anyone behind.

## Coding interviews are the basis for an entire cottage industry dedicated to help you "ace" them

This is related to the other problems I mentioned. If coding interviews were actually relevant to the work we
do every day, we wouldn't need a dedicated industry 

cottage industry just to help get thru it


solve for best comp sci grad not who can solve business problems. real life doesnt involve someone looking over your shoulder judging
no googling or stack overflow
proof is an entire industry built around acing the tech interview which wouldnt be necessary if the interviews were a proxy for real life

variability in challenges: favoristim, different interviewers with diff biases

no analysis of soft skills

languages/frameworks come and go. want knowledge of abstractions and patterns

robs joy and adds pressure particularly for excluded populations

vanity exercise for the interviewer

instead
  what are examples of problems you solved at work and thought processes and approached you took to solving them
  provide example of a technical challenge at work that made you realize why you love working in tech
  what kinds of conflicts have you had on technical approached with team members and how did you move forward
  diverse panels of interviewers
  observe toxic behavior like refusing to acknoledge remale interviewers

but if you must
  offer candidates options about take home (pay them) vs live coding
  solve a real work problem
  make it collaborative and interactive
  make comfortable
  provide resources
