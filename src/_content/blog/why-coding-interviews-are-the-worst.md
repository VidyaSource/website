Tech interviews are broken. Much like with vegan cheese, we all agree there is a problem, but we all differ on how to fix it. How did we get here?

Over the last several decades as tech became a dominant industry, the new personalities that became very rich
very fast also became very Gavin Belson from Silicon Valley—supremely convinced of their own outside-the-box cleverness
not only at producing revolutionary technology but also at revolutionizing the way they build it as a model for everyone else. Remember when open floor plans
with foosball tables were the key to unleashing workplace productivity restrained too long by dehumanizing cubicles? The media 
ate that up!

But we ended up just using headphones to fashion our own mental cubicles so we could work in some kind of awkward peace—particularly awkward
for women, people of color, introverts, and many others.

A similar thing happened with tech interviews. Boring accounting firms ask about your resume but not us! The media were awestruck at
our novel interview style asking weird questions like "*Why are manhole covers round?*" or "*How would you calculate the number of cars passing through a busy bridge?*"
or the famous Elon Musk riddle "*You’re standing on the surface of the Earth. You walk one mile south, one mile west, and one mile north. You end up exactly where you started. Where are you?*"
This was all about getting deeper than any traditional interview could, you see, to reveal how candidates think!

Yeah, OK.

While the more absurd questions have lost some luster, one relic of our unconventional interview style that endures is the 
coding interview. You know it. The panel of dudes who all vaguely remind you of Howard from *The Big Bang Theory* asks you 
to go to the whiteboard or a laptop broadcasting to a screen and write code for something you've probably never seen (by design).
It could be implementing a doubly-linked list or merge sort or a function that determines if a 
string is a palindrome. It could be performing a breadth-first search or converting a loop into a recursive function. And on and on.

This is a problem—not only for job candidates but also for the companies considering them. It's an especially acute problem now with the shortage of software 
engineers, the popularity of remote work particularly in the aftermath of a global pandemic, the uncertainty tech companies
feel in an era of inflation and changing pandemic fundamentals, and the uncertainty candidates feel in an era of layoffs and evolving 
personal responsibilities and professional goals.

Coding interviews are the worst. How do we know this?

## Coding interviews solve for the most short term knowledge not the best long term teammate

not what you know but how much you can learn
tech always changing
culture fit
kindness

## Coding interviews do not reflect the skills necessary to excel in your actual working environment

## Coding interviews do not reflect the conditions in your actual working environment

high pressure
esp for women, poc
people watching
no google, stack overflow

## Coding interviews are the basis for an entire cottage industry dedicated to help you "ace" them



cottage industry just to help get thru it


solve for best comp sci grad not who can solve business problems. real life doesnt involve someone looking over your shoulder judging
no googling or stack overflow
proof is an entire industry built around acing the tech interview which wouldnt be necessary if the interviews were a proxy for real life

variability in challenges: favoristim, different interviewers with diff biases

no analysis of soft skills

languages/frameworks come and go. want knowledge of abstractions and patterns

robs joy and adds pressure particularly for excluded populations

vanity exercise for the interviewer

instead
  what are examples of problems you solved at work and thought processes and approached you took to solving them
  provide example of a technical challenge at work that made you realize why you love working in tech
  what kinds of conflicts have you had on technical approached with team members and how did you move forward
  diverse panels of interviewers
  observe toxic behavior like refusing to acknoledge remale interviewers

but if you must
  offer candidates options about take home (pay them) vs live coding
  solve a real work problem
  make it collaborative and interactive
  make comfortable
  provide resources
