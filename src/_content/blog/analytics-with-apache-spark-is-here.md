As promised earlier this year, we at Vidya are proud to officially announce our newest course 
[Software Engineering with Apache Spark](/courses/software-engineering-with-apache-spark). 
Spark is a cool technology making an enormous--and growing--impact in the Big Data space, so naturally there are a lot
of courses out there. Ours is different. 

Naturally we spend a lot of time on Spark itself with numerous code examples and challenging
exercises, but we also stress the importance of things that have always mattered and still matter--architecture, security, 
and software engineering concepts like unit and integration testing, continuous integration, and continuous delivery. Courses
seem to ignore these concerns even though they are actually *more* important in a complex, distributed environment. 

We even survey many of the other leading analytics tools out there so you can get a feel for your options and make informed 
technical decisions.   

All of this distinguishes [our Spark course](/courses/software-engineering-with-apache-spark) 
from all the others. We hope you will consider it if you want to make your mark
in the Big Data landscape.

Feel free to check out our other courses too--[Java for Work](/courses/java-for-work)
and [Modern Agile](/courses/modern-agile).
