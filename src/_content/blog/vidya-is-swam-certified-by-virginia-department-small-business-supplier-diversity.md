I am excited to announce that hot off the heels of [8(a) certification by the US Small Business Administration](/blog/vidya-is-8a-certified-by-us-small-business-administration),
Vidya is now also Small, Micro, Minority Owned, and 8(a) Certified by the [Virginia Department of Small Business and Supplier Diversity (SBSD)](https://www.sbsd.virginia.gov/certification-division/swam/).

At Vidya, we have been very privileged to deliver high-quality software to a wide array of government and commercial clients
using exciting technology while promoting lean principles, agile software development,
and diversity in software engineering. The best part about it? It's been fun! Doing great work and contributing to the community—whether 
writing on [our blog](/blog/), answering questions on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1347281/vidya),
contributing to open-source on [GitHub](https://github.com/VidyaSource), 
speaking at [conferences](/blog/speaking-at-code-writers-workshop-2017/), and even posting video tutorials on 
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC24LVc8Bb65SF6LW-SLog9A)—have been the most rewarding professional experience of my life.  

Vidya is based in Virginia just outside Washington, DC, and SWaM certification by SBSD shows Virginia Vidya has demonstrated the kind of growth potential that should make state government agencies 
who need technology services take notice. As they [describe](https://www.sbsd.virginia.gov/certification-division/swam/):

> The purpose is to enhance procurement opportunities for SWaM businesses participating in state-funded projects.

We look forward to building new relationships and to delivering our services to government agencies in the state of Virginia. We are also excited about expanding
our current offerings by making our courses available online and building new software products.

We want to thank the Virginia Department of Small Business and Supplier Diversity for recognizing Vidya's past success and future potential, and we cannot wait to do business
with you. [Let's talk](/contact).
