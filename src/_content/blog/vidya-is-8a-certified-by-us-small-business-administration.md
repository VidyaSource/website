I don't have to tell you it's been a difficult few years, so I am absolutely thrilled to announce 
[US Small Business Administration (SBA)](https://www.sba.gov/) has certified Vidya as an 
[8(a) business](https://www.sba.gov/federal-contracting/contracting-assistance-programs/8a-business-development-program).

At Vidya, we have been very privileged to deliver high-quality software to a wide array of government and commercial clients
using exciting technology while promoting lean principles, agile software development,
and diversity in software engineering. The best part about it? It's been fun! Doing great work and contributing to the community—whether 
writing on [our blog](/blog/), answering questions on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1347281/vidya),
contributing to open-source on [GitHub](https://github.com/VidyaSource), 
speaking at [conferences](/blog/speaking-at-code-writers-workshop-2017/), and even posting video tutorials on 
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC24LVc8Bb65SF6LW-SLog9A)—have been the most rewarding professional experience of my life.  

8(a) certification by SBA shows the nation that Vidya has demonstrated the kind of growth potential that should make government agencies 
who need technology services take notice. As they [describe](https://www.sba.gov/about-sba):

> SBA is the only cabinet-level federal agency fully dedicated to small business and provides counseling, capital, and contracting expertise as the nation’s only go-to resource and voice for small businesses.

We look forward to building new relationships and to delivering our services to even more government agencies. We are also excited about expanding
our current offerings by making our courses available online and building new software products.

We want to thank SBA for recognizing Vidya's past success and future potential, and we cannot wait to do business
with you. [Let's talk](/contact).
